# How to configure an ArcGIS Online product for sharing

In order to publish **maps** you have created in ArcGIS Online in a StoryMap, the data source *and* web map must be shared as public.

If you are having problems sharing your ArcGIS Online product, try this:

> Navigate to the data source, feature layer, *and* web map for the data or map you want to bring into your StoryMap, and make sure *each item* is set to `Public` and is populated with `tags`.

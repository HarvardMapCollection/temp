# How to explore census data online with Social Explorer

This tutorial will walk through the following [Social Explorer](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.eresource:socialex) tasks:
- Changing the map by picking a demographic variable
- Adding or uploading additional datasets for comparison
- Exporting census visualizations as rendered map .png files

>**Tip:** [Censusreporter.org](https://censusreporter.org/) is a tool for learning which census variables are available, and how they are collected.

## Example use case 

This tutorial will practice exploring data based on the following parameters:
- **Topic:** The `tenure` variable, which looks at owner vs. renter-occupied units.
- **Geographic Level:** Census responses that have been aggregated to the **census tract** level.
- **Location:** Near the Harvard campus, in Somerville and Cambridge. 
- **Year:** The most recent [estimates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/estimates.html) at the time this guide was written, 2015-2019.

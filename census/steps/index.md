# Census data for digital mapping

This tutorial series will equip you with the skills needed to use United States census data to create a digital map.

## Lessons

[01 - Downloading the software](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/download/)
This step-by-step tutorial will cover how to download QGIS, a free mapping software which will allow you to work with census data. 

[02 - Downloading the data](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/census/obtaining-census-data/)
This step-by-step tutorial will cover where to acquire the two types of census files you will need to make a map: (1) a table with statistics and (2) a GIS boundary file. 

[03 - Performing a table join](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/join)
This step-by-step tutorial will cover how to perform a table join linking the mapping file together with the statistical file -- a step necessary to make a map.

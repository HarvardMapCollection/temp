# How to style the map

Depending on whether you plan to make a static map, or there is some necessary interactive functionality required, the steps towards stying the map may be a bit different.

You can skim these tutorials to glean recommended settings for using the [Print Layout](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/training_manual/map_composer/map_composer.html) in QGIS.

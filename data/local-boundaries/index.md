## How to Search for Local Boundary Files

To make maps, you often need to find cartographic data such as:
- roads
- rivers and water features
- parks
- buildings
- place labels
- administrative boundaries

Some sites like [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) provide a great one-stop-shop for global cartographic data of this kind.

Sometimes, however, you need more granular, place-specific cartographic data. In this tutorial we will conduct a search for the outlines or boundaries of towns in the state of Massachusetts.

## Searching for data example

1. In a search engine, type in "Massachusetts + GIS + data".
> A great way to start searching for data is to find open government GIS portals.

2. Your results should bring you to [MassGIS (Bureau of Geographic Information)](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massgis-bureau-of-geographic-information). Visit this site.

3. Click `Download MassGIS Data`.

4. In the search bar, enter "Towns".

5. Click the first result, `MassGIS Data: Municipalities`.
> We can see this is a `shp` or *shapefile*. 

6. Under downloads select `Download Shapefile`.

7. Learn how to open shapefiles in GIS software using the tutorial, [How to open vector data in QGIS](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/open-vector).

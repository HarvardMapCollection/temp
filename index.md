## Georeferencing
[Georeferencing 01 - In the browser using Allmaps](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/allmaps/georeference) This tutorial outlines the process for georeferencing a map from directly from the Harvard Libraries digital collections.

[Georeferencing 02 -  With QGIS](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/georeference) This tutorial describes georeferencing a map image file (`.PNG`, `.JPEG`, or `.TIFF`). 

## Research

[Research 01 - DIY Metadata](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/data/DIY-metadata) This template provides suggestions for information to include when documenting self-authored GIS datasets.



## QGIS
[QGIS 01 - Downloading QGIS](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/download/) This tutorial provides instructions and tips for downloading QGIS, a free desktop software for processing, analysing, and visualizing map data. 

[QGIS 02 - Adding a basemap to a mapping project](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/add-a-basemap/) This tutorial describes adding a basemap to a QGIS project as a reference layer.

[QGIS 03 - Adding a vector dataset to a mapping project](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/open-vector) This tutorial discusses vector data formats (points, lines, and polygons), their relevance to GIS, and adding these formats to a QGIS mapping project. 


[QGIS 04 - Adding a spreadsheet to a mapping project](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/add-csv) This tutorial explains adding a spreadsheet or table of data (.xlsx or .csv) to a QGIS project so that the contents of the file can become map data.


[QGIS 05 - Performing a table join](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/join) This tutorial and reference guide covers the concepts behind table joins and instructions for performing them using QGIS. 


[QGIS 06 - Exporting selected features](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/export-selected) This tutorial provides an examples for filtering a dataset down based on some criteria, and exporting the results to a new GIS dataset.


[QGIS 07 - Changing the coordinate reference system (CRS)](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/change-crs) This tutorial and reference guide covers the basics of coordinate reference systems (CRS), highlights their importance, and provides instructions for changing a CRS when necessary.



[QGIS 08 - Zooming to a layer](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/zoom-to-layer) This tutorial covers a useful tool in QGIS -- zooming to a layer. This tool is helpful for locating a dataset's extent within the larger context of a mapping project.


[QGIS 09 - Clipping a dataset](https://harvardmapcollection.github.io/tutorials/qgis/clip) This tutorial and reference guide covers concepts about and instructions for clipping datasets by desired geographies, as well as tips for troubleshooting.
